This file presents the instructions for running the Python program to run a command line interface to retrive data, using Treasure Data Python Library, from Treasure Data. The data will be based on the query parameters provided at the command line. 

Pre-requisites:
1. The system where will program will be run needs to have Python 2.7.x installed and the path set to run Python script from any folder. 
2. The Treasure Data Python Client Library will need to be installed as well. The library can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/treasure-data/td-client-python) or by using the 'pip install td-client' command.


Setup:
1. Download the TD Python Sample repository from Github URL: https://github.com/vinayakkarnataki/td-python-sample.git
2. The repository consists of 3 folders apart from the Readme and Setup files that are in the root folder.
3. The PythonScripts folder contains Python programs that retrieve data from Treasure Data using the td-client library.
4. The Scripts folder contain 2 shell scripts that need to be run to setup the environment before executing any of the programs.
5. The Queries program contains the queries, outputs and results for 10 different combinations of arguments. 

Running the Programs:
1. Run the setTDAPIKEY.sh file. This file sets the environment variable 'TD_API_KEY' with the appropriate value of the key to access the TreasureData database.
2. Run the alias.sh to setup an alias for the python command. Running the script will result in an alias 'query' being created in lieu of 'python td_sample.py'.
3. Copy both the python files to a folder of your choice.
4. Run the td_sample.py from the command prompt using the alias 'query'. An example command could look like this: query -d <db_name> -t <table_name> -c <column list> -f <file type> -e <engine> -m <minimum time> -M <maximum time> -l <row limit>
5. The first 2 parameters are required while the rest are optional. 
6. -d parameter takes the database name. For the sake of this exercise the database name will be 'membership'.
7. -t parameter takes the table name. For the sake of this exercise the table name will be 'members'.
8. -c parameter takes the list of columns separated by comma. For e.g -c 'col1,col2,col3'
9. -f parameter takes the file type for results. File type can either be csv or tsv. tsv is the default.
10. -e parameter defines the engine to be used. 'Hive' or 'Presto' are the 2 options with presto being the default.
11. -m parameter defines the minimum value of the time column for the search. The default is 0
12. -M parameter defines the maximum value of the time column for the search. The default is infinite. 
13. -l parameter defines the maximum number of records that can be retrieved for a query. The default is 100 rows.
14. The results are recorded in the 'results_query.csv' or 'results_query.txt' depending upon the choice of file format.
15. The stdout is directed to stdout_query.txt file.
